The boards that mean the world! <br>
This well-known phrase comes from the poet Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805). In his poem "To the Friends" it says:
Let's see the great things of all time. On the boards that mean the world
Pass us by in silence. Everything just repeats itself in life
Only the imagination is forever young; What has never and nowhere happened
That alone never becomes out of date!

Shakespeare! <br>
The quote is from William Shakespeare's "Hamlet". 
Here is the English original: "To be or not to be, that is the question!" Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, calls out the desperate sentence when he no longer knows what to do. His father was murdered by his uncle. Now Hamlet is faced with the task of killing his uncle as an act of revenge.

A revolving stage! <br>
Many large theaters work with so-called revolving stages: while part of the stage is played by the actors, the next stage can be set up on the other side, 
the part of the stage that the audience cannot see at the moment. This means that there are no unnecessary breaks in renovation.    </details>
