                The boards that mean the world! <br />
                This well-known phrase comes from the poet Friedrich Schiller
                (1759-1805). In his poem "To the Friends" it says: Let's see the
                great things of all time. On the boards that mean the world Pass
                us by in silence. Everything just repeats itself in life Only
                the imagination is forever young; What has never and nowhere
                happened That alone never becomes out of date!

                Shakespeare! <br />
                The quote is from William Shakespeare's "Hamlet". Here is the
                English original: "To be or not to be, that is the question!"
                Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, calls out the desperate sentence when
                he no longer knows what to do. His father was murdered by his
                uncle. Now Hamlet is faced with the task of killing his uncle as
                an act of revenge.

                A revolving stage! <br />
                Many large theaters work with so-called revolving stages: while
                part of the stage is played by the actors, the next stage can be
                set up on the other side, the part of the stage that the
                audience cannot see at the moment. This means that there are no
                unnecessary breaks in renovation.
